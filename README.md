## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ and [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- A [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and its token (see [tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token))
- An [OpenAI](https://openai.com) account (see [configuration](#configuration) section)

## Getting started

### Configuration
Customize the configuration by copying `.env.example` and renaming it to `.env`, then editing the settings as desired:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>"
ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS="<USER_ID_1>,<USER_ID_2>,..." # Defaults to "*" (everyone)
SHOW_USAGE=false
```
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key, get if from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
* `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot's token, obtained using [BotFather](http://t.me/botfather) (see [tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token))
* `ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS`: A comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs that are allowed to interact with the bot (use [getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot) to find your user ID). **Important**: by default, *everyone* is allowed (`*`)
* `SHOW_USAGE`: Whether to show OpenAI token usage information after each response. Optional, defaults to `false`

Additional optional model parameters can be configured from the `main.py` file:
```python
{
    # 'gpt-3.5-turbo' or 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0301'
    'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    
    # An initial system message that sets the tone and controls the behavior of the assistant.
    'assistant_prompt': 'You are a helpful assistant.',
    
    # Number between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
    # while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. Defaults to 1
    'temperature': 1,
    
    # How many answers to generate for each input message. Defaults to 1
    'n_choices': 1,
    
    # The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. Defaults to 4096 minus prompt tokens
    'max_tokens': 1200,
    
    # Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether
    # they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Defaults to 0
    'presence_penalty': 0,
    
    # Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing
    # frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. Defaults to 0
    'frequency_penalty': 0
}
```
