A [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) that integrates with OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to provide answers. Ready to use with minimal configuration required. Based on [acheong08/ChatGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT)

## Features
- [x] Reply to specific messages
- [x] Support markdown in answers
- [x] Can reset conversation thread with the `/reset` command
- [x] Typing indicator while generating a response
- [x] Access can be restricted by specifying a list of allowed users

## Additional Features - help needed!
- [ ] Multi-chat support
  - Idea: cache different instances of `ChatGPT3Bot`, one for every chat id (maybe even persist them), so that every user has their own private conversation
- [ ] Support group chats
  - Allow the bot to be used in group chats with specific commands
- [ ] Docker support
  - With `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. See [pull/2](https://github.com/n3d1117/chatgpt-telegram-bot/pull/2) for a start
- [ ] Advanced commands
  - With premade ad-hoc prompts
- [ ] Token based authentication 
  - As an alternative to email/password authentication for those who signed up with other services (Google/Microsoft) or for those who get a `Captcha detected` error, see [#13](https://github.com/n3d1117/chatgpt-telegram-bot/issues/13)

PRs are always welcome!

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ and [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- A [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and its token (see [tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token))
- An [OpenAI](https://openai.com) account (see [configuration](#configuration) section)

## Getting started

### Installing
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n3d1117/chatgpt-telegram-bot.git
cd chatgpt-telegram-bot
```

2. Create a new virtual environment with Pipenv and install the required dependencies:
```
pipenv install
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```
pipenv shell
```

### Configuration
Customize the configuration by copying `.env.example` and renaming it to `.env`, then editing the settings as desired:
```bash
OPENAI_EMAIL="<YOUR_OPENAI_EMAIL>"
OPENAI_PASSWORD="<YOUR_OPENAI_PASSWORD>"
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>"
```
* `OPENAI_EMAIL,OPENAI_PASSWORD`: Your OpenAI credentials (these are only sent to the OpenAI server to periodically refresh the access token and never shared). You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT)
* `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Telegram bot's token, obtained using [BotFather](http://t.me/botfather) (see [tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token))

Additional optional (but recommended) configuration values:
```bash
ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS="<USER_ID_1>,<USER_ID_2>,..." # Defaults to "*"
PROXY="<HTTP/HTTPS_PROXY>" # E.g. "http://localhost:8080", defaults to none
DEBUG=false # Defaults to true
```
* `ALLOWED_TELEGRAM_USER_IDS`: A comma-separated list of Telegram user IDs that are allowed to interact with the bot (use [getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot) to find your user ID). **Important**: by default, *everyone* is allowed (`*`)
* `PROXY`: Proxy to be used when authenticating with OpenAI
* `DEBUG`: Enable debug logging for the [revChatGpt](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT) package

### Run
Use the following command to start the bot:
```
python main.py
```
